## Assumptions:  
* Changing the db is not ok but adding auto incrementing primary keys should be based on info from the course mentors.

* I assume the contact from the Data Base can be considered a consultant.

* Type is not a data base feild so I will use the description field as type.

*  Valid logins: 
test	test, 
user1	user1,
user2	user2,
admin	admin
